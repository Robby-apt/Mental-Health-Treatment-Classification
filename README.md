This project is a machine learning classification for a survey on mental health in the tech industry.
The aim of the project is to classify whether individuals should be treated for mental health issues
based on a number of different factors from their work environment to histroy of mental illness in their
families.

The steps followed are as follows:
    > Data cleaning
    > Exploratory data analysis
    > Building the models and crossvalidating
    > Scaling the data
    > Rebuilding the models and crossvalidating again
    > Hyper-parameter tuning

The project is deployed using flask and can be found on https://mental-health-in-tech-ml.herokuapp.com/
